## Introduction

Simple project I found on YouTube(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L02BfvA7mgA) to create a good foundation of the most basic TypeScript concepts. It is literally a cli calculator

## Future Implementations

I would like to make it as close to a scientific calculator as possible, including the possibility of solving complex equations, differentials, integrals, volumes and areas of complex figures... 
Coming fron an engineering background, I know these type of calculations can be done through softwares like Matlab, It would be cool to code it all by myself :)

## Installation

You just need nodeJS (https://nodejs.org/en/download/), TypeScript (npm install -g typescript) and readline-sync (npm --save readline-sync), this will read what you write on the terminal.
